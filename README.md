# A FastAPI project template

This project was based on [manage-fastapi](https://ycd.github.io/manage-fastapi) template

## A few words about Python version

Well, technically, this template is only for Python >= 3.11 but you could change it in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) file and pray that everything'll be cool (and it probably will)
